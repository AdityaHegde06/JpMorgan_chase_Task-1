# Stock Price Data Feed Interface

This project is designed to interface with a stock price data feed, allowing users to retrieve real-time or historical stock price data. This can be useful for building financial applications, conducting market analysis, or integrating stock data into your existing projects.

## Features

- **Real-time Stock Prices**: Fetch the latest stock prices for various companies.
- **Historical Data**: Access past stock prices for analysis.
- **Data Filtering**: Filter data based on specific criteria, such as date ranges or stock symbols.
- **API Integration**: Easy integration with stock price APIs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-data-feed.git
   cd stock-price-data-feed
   ```

2. **Install Required Dependencies:**

   Install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuration

1. **API Key:**

   Obtain an API key from your chosen stock price data provider (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance API).

2. **Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your API key:

   ```
   API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

### Usage

1. **Fetch Real-Time Stock Prices:**

   To fetch real-time stock prices, use the following command:

   ```bash
   python fetch_realtime.py --symbol AAPL
   ```

2. **Fetch Historical Stock Data:**

   To retrieve historical data, specify the stock symbol and date range:

   ```bash
   python fetch_historical.py --symbol AAPL --start-date 2023-01-01 --end-date 2023-01-31
   ```

### Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the data feed interface:

- **Get Latest Stock Price:**

  ```python
  from stock_feed import StockFeed

  feed = StockFeed(api_key="your_api_key_here")
  latest_price = feed.get_realtime_price("AAPL")
  print(f"Latest price for AAPL: {latest_price}")
  ```

- **Fetch Historical Data:**

  ```python
  historical_data = feed.get_historical_data("AAPL", "2023-01-01", "2023-01-31")
  print(historical_data)
  ```
